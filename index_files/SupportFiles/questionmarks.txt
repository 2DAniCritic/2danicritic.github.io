When exporting to html, strange <?> may appear.

To resolve, go to far right of excel page and enter following formula for title/studio/directors/country/format:

=TRIM(CLEAN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,CHAR(160)," ")))

Copy new text values back to table, remove new table.



Other tips:

- Convert columns with text to numbers using "=VALUE()" (similar process to above).

- If using extra rows and columns for junk data, their contents might not be properly deleted, causing the size of the file to be much larger than necessary.
	Regularly delete excess rows beyond where the data is stored.
