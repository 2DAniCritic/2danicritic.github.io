<p>"The Secret of Kells" took indie audiences by storm when it released in 2009. How could Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon follow up with such a success? Perhaps... make another Ireland-set movie?</br></br>Anyone who has read my opinion of "The Secret of Kells" knows that I consider the Irish setting the biggest strength of that movie, but also the biggest detriment to its story. Unfortunately, 2014's "Song of the Sea" suffers many of the same problems. Instead of the classic green of the grassy plains, it trades for the blue of the ocean that surrounds the isles, setting the story at present day instead of millenia ago. But without having The Book of Kells as the inspiration to tie everything down, "Song of the Sea" feels loose, like a dreamy bedtime story. That's probably the tone it was going for, but it isn't a good sign when both adults and children fall asleep halfway through.</br></br>The story revolves around a family that lives in a lighthouse. While a mystery at first, the mother was secretly a Selkie in human form (a "Selkie" is a Scottish name for the urban myth of "Seal Folk," similar to mermaids), and she disappears the night she gives birth to a daughter named Saoirse. With only the father and older brother to look after the little sister... well, brother Ben blames her for their mother's apparent death, and the two have trouble getting along, despite Saoirse's best intentions. When she's about six years-old, their grandmother insists on taking the kids away from the water, to live with her in the crowded urban city. For the rest of the movie, the kids journey back to the ocean, as Saoirse learns that she, too, is a Selkie, and slowly convinces her brother of this secret, and of her destiny to return to the sea.</br></br>It is a nice story. And whatever my opinion, I can't deny I teared up at the ending. But it is also very sleepy, and lacks any sense of legitimate urgency. There are other fantastical elements of fairies and sprites from Irish mythology, and like" Kells," it feels shoehorned in and unnessessary. A story staring children under ten-years of age are prone to being less enjoyable for adults, but I'm certain that even children would be bored with "Song of the Sea," despite any attempts of humor or tension.</br></br>But Cartoon Saloon still has a beuatiful sense of art and design. Many scenes are inspired by circles and ocean waves, making me think that the slow and hypnotic atmosphere was an intentional choice. There are moments that make me yearn for wallpaper art or a poster. The music is also a bit more improved in its ambiance. </br></br>For artisitic integrity, I appreciate "Song of the Sea" as a part of Cartoon Saloon's growing catelogue of films. And those with a great love for the sea, or perhaps siblings, will find a lot to appreciate in the story and the visuals. But unlike other films Cartoon Saloon has made, I simply can't feel excited to recommend this movie to anyone. It's certainly a good movie, and you should definitely see it, but recommending a movie because it is just "good" isn't very convincing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
