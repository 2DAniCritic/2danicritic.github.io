<p>"So I Can't Play H!" is the type of title that anime fans will almost immediately understand, and avoid, while outsiders would be confused with what the "H!" stands for. We'll assume the "H" stands for "hentai," or some other word meaning porn. In North America, the DVD release features a naked red-headed girl, a close-up such that her chest is conveniently covered by the series logo. It doesn't shy away from who it's selling to. Embarrasing though it may be to own such a show, let alone watch it, the jokey title is a little misleading. Yes, sexy things do occur, but not at the frequency you would imagine, but there is an interesting fantasy plot at work here... no, not just "that" kind of "plot."</br></br>The story involves Ryosuke, a typical high school boy that will end up being the chosen hero to save the world in due time. But first, he's just a typical nice-guy-slash-pervert. He happens to come upon a beautiful young woman in the rain (the "red-head" poster girl), and after inviting her to his home to dry off, getting stabbed by a magical sword by her (you know, the usual), we learn that Lisara is a grim reaper tasked to find someone in the human world. Also, Ryosuke is fated to die in three months, and unbeknowst to him, has a few magical powers of his own (likely powered by his hot-blooded perversion). And so the quest to save the world, with the help of a harem of pretty girls, begins!</br></br>"So I Can't Play H!" had some trouble competing with the first season of "High School DxD," also relased in the same year, just months earlier. Both feature a sexy red-head lead, a secret world of demons and a hapless high-school student at the center of it all. "DxD" would go on to be one of the more popular shows of its genre with multiple seasons, while "H!" was quickly forgotten. "DxD" is a bit more fun, has better visuals, and a bit more fanservice, so it's easier to recommend over "H!" for the target audience. On the other hand, "H!" has a few strengths of its own that prevent it from being just another peep show.</br></br>"So I Can't Play H!" mostly takes its story seriously, which pays off near the end. After a climatic battle, the show takes a surprising psychological turn with the lead hero. Without spoiling it entirely, I'll just say it woke me up, genuinely interested in what would happen next. I appreciated the effort as one of the few things I remember from the story. It also ties into the romance aspect: the relationship between Ryosuke and Lisara actually grows to a substantial one, more than most anime will dare, a sweet way to drive the action of the true ending. Also, this 12-episode season is mostly stand-alone, successfully ending without much need for further adventures, although I wouldn't refuse any should they appear. </br></br>That's a lot of bonus points for a show like this. The fanservice isn't too frequent (although it's plenty risque when it does come up), such that it wouldn't satisfy fans who only want that. If they don't mind the extra features, it's likely they'll walk away impressed like I did.</br></br>Other than the story, the production values of the show are reasonable. The character designs are slightly more stylized than average, making for an attractive and colorful palette most of the time. Animation is reasonable, but not beyond average. There is no English dub, but I didn't have any paritcular issue with the Japanese acting. </br></br>It's hard to imagine calling a show named "So I Can't Play H!" a favorite, but that's what "guilty pleasure" shows are for, right? I think you'll like it too. Don't worry, you don't have to admit it. Your secret is safe with me.</br></br></br></br></p>
