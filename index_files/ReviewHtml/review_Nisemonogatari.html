<p>"Bakemonogatari" is a fan favorite. But then it continued, with "Nisemonogatari," and then later, an official second season. The biggest flaw of "Nisemonogatari" is that it exists, as it proves the franchise can be near infinite, when the first season was more than enough on its own. But it is still well-written and keeps all the parts that made the original show interesting.</br></br>Araragi has two younger sisters. We see them briefly in "Bakemonogatari," but this gives them focus. We learn in two arcs (one for each of them) what sort of characters they are. Basically, annoying, but Araragi still pesters them unfairly. The first arc is interesting, but ultimately more so for Senjogahara than the older sister, and ultimately ends with little excitement. The second arc is much more interesting, but focuses even less time to the youngest sister despite her name being in the arc's title.</br></br>And yet, the two sisters get plenty of screentime overall, shared with the other six girls. It feels strange to consider them as adding the Araragi's harem with incest, but they come close to. They are very cute, so certain viewers will be very happy of that. But the show does struggle giving all the girls proper attention equally, which will no doubt be a problem in future extensions. Also, it becomes more clear that all the girls have feelings for Araragi, which only further complicate my feelings (one of the best parts of "Bakemonogatari" is that they didn't suggest that).</br></br>Otherwise, all the stuff you liked about Bakemonogatari are still here. Interesting monster stories, fantastic writing. Fanservice is arguably more pronounced here. The "villains" are interesting characters that I hope to see more of, and bring interesting viewpoints that help make it stand out from the previous season. Great animation, audio, visuals, openings and endings.</br></br>If you have watched both "Bakemonogatari" and "Nisemonogatari," you'll discover the franchise as a whole has over 50 episodes to slog through if you need to see it all. Eventually, I will get tired of the Monogatari series. But not yet. And if you are looking for an ending point without investing in it all, "Nisemonogatari" is a solid cap.</br></br></br></p>
