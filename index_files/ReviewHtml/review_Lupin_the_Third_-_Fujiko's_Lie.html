<p>"Lupin the Third - The Woman Called Fujiko Mine" was a seemingly once-in-a-lifetime series, showing a hard-boild noir, sexualized, adult-focused version of the classic anime characters from the Lupin the Third franchise. It's success not only encouraged a renaissance for Lupin (earning new official television seasons instead of just further uninspired tv specials), but three spin-off feature films, each using the adult nature and sharp style from "The Woman Called." It took a while (TMS kept international streaming rights, playing with the opportunity to keep profits made outside of Japan), but Discotek did eventually release all three of the films in America, including a speedy release for the laste one: "Fujiko Mine's Lie" (like before, it's organized as two 25-minute episodes, combined for a relatively short feature).</br></br>... back to Fujiko, eh? The 13-episode series already covered a lot on her. The first two films focused on Jigen and Goemon, giving them well-earned time in the spotlight. To return to Fujiko is a nice way to end this spin-off trilogy, but also feels like a missed opportunity. Yes, the franchise doesn't have too many other characters to use... the only other choices would have been Inspector Zenigata, or Lupin himself (who already has dozens of films where he's the star, and hardly needs another). Whatever the case, even if returning the Fujiko was always the plan, it would be difficult to tell a new story with her that we haven't already seen. </br></br>Luckily, "Fujiko's Lie" makes an inspired choice with the story, putting her in charge of a kid. We drop in with her taking care of a child named Gene, acting as maid to him and his father in a small house in the middle of a sandy nowhere. The three are hiding, and quickly get discovered: at the orders of the father, Fujiko escapes with Gene, while the father blows the house (and himself) up. From there, we learn the backstory: the father worked for a large corporation and stole hundreds of millions of dollars, hoping it could be used to pay for Gene's necessary heart transplant (and any necessities while on the run from the law for the crime). The money is stored in a bank security box, and with the father gone, only Gene knows the location and passcode to retrieve it. The company wants that money back, and has shady ties to a lab that breeds assassins to make use of: Bincam is a pale, slender man with the unusual ability to create a small sandstorm that forces anyone that breathes it to follow his orders (like telling their secrets), and is kept on a leash by his handlers. They don't need to harm the boy if they get the money, but for simply knowing that the company hired assassins at all, they probably won't let him live.</br></br>Naturally, Fujiko knew exactly what she was getting into, planting herself to run off with the money. Lupin the Third and Jigen act as a third party after the fortune (Goemon doesn't make an appearance). But with his father dead, the naive and feeble Gene is willing to give up everything to get revenge for his dad: he offers the bank passcode to Lupin for killing Bincam. And he won't dare give it to Fujiko. She was always able to trick adult men with her charms, but that doesn't work for a kid. And despite acting like a mother who only cares for Gene's safety, Gene sees through Fujiko's multiple lies, and like most kids, quickly looses all trust in the lying adult. All Fujiko is left to do is to use her "skills" on the adults that remain involved (as well as her high-kicks and agility in a fight). </br></br><img src="../ReviewImages/review_Lupin_the_Third_-_Fujiko's_Lie2.jpg" alt="" style="width:720px;height:404px;">
</br></br>Like the previous two films, "Fujiko's Lie" isn't for children, with a few sexual references and grusome violence. The content isn't quite as extreme, though: despite a great one-on-one fight with Fujiko in the final quater, there's not nearly as much violence as either "Jigen's Gravestone" or "Goemon's Blood Spray." Even the sexual content her isn't as aggresive as "Jigen's Gravestone," or most of the arcs in "The Woman Called." I'd even argue that the villains in "Lie" aren't as good (or as fun) as either "Gravestone" or "Blood Spray." With all that in mind, and now with the feeling of repittion after three films... I'd argue that "Fujiko's Lie" is the weakest of them, if only by a little.</br></br>Even so, the story is engaging, largely thanks to Fujiko being a much more complex character than the others in the gang (granted, NONE OF THEM are all that complicated, but still). The cast is still cooler than they've ever been, with a scene or two with writing worthy to be in a Quentin Taranteno film. In a clever move, "Fujiko's Lie" even throws in cameos from "Gravestone" and "Blood Spray," for the first time trying to tie the three together, even though it's a little lazy (I know have to rewatch all of them: "Lie" plays with chronological order, potentially explaining why Lupin and his crew were being hunted in the first place). In fact, both this "ending" for the overarching story and this standalone one were a little disappointing, not leaving me with the same satisfaction as the others. There's not much reason to complain: these issues make "Lie's" story in my top 5 for Lupin's movies, rather than top 3. </br></br>There isn't much left to say about the visual style or animation that I haven't already said in my previous reviews. It still looks much more boldly stylized than most of Lupin's movies, and animates well (but by now, not quite as inspired in setting or animation as the previous two films). I want an artbook for all the character designs. The soundtrack is cool. The English dub is acted well and translated well. </br></br>Ever sine "Jigen's Gravestone," I've craved and eaten up these spin-off films like a kid eating sugar. With "Fujiko's Lie," we come back to the girl that started the whole spin-off series, as well as tie the previous films together to feel like a proper trilogy... except... I think the movies never revealed who the true boss behind all three stories were. "Lie" feels like the typical "penultimate" story in a larger series, with the final battle still to come. By now, I think I've had my fill after "Lie," but maybe... just maybe... there'd be room for one more. </br></br></p>
