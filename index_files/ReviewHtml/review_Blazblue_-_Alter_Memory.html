<p>"Blazblue" is a relatively recent 2D-fighting video game series, from the makers of another cult franchise called 'Guilty Gear." It was able to gain a dedicated niche following, enough for it to be listed in fighting tournaments alongside "Street Fighter," "Tekken," and "Super Smash Bros." What makes "Blazblue" successful? Is it the sharp-edged anime character designs? Is it the fast-paced combo gameplay? The electric-guitar-pulsing soundtrack? Unlike most other fighting games, the STORY is one of the best elements, and one of the major reasons I fell in love with the series (although the story has gone downhill a bit after "Continuum Shift"). </br></br>It makes sense then that an anime adaptation would come around eventually. "Blazblue - Alter Memory" is that adaptation, broadcasting in 2013. I'll be upfront: it's not a good show. In fact, if this is your first entry into the "Blazblue" franchise, it's a horrible show. The story and setting seems dense and randomly convoluted, and the production values leave much to be desired. My review score partially accounts for this, but also accounts my own perspective, as a relatively dedicated "Blazblue" fan. From that perspective, the character designs and setting are acceptable, and more importantly, the story actually has some purpose in the grand scheme.</br></br>"Blazblue"'s general story is as complex as any anime-fantasy story can get. Set in the year 2199, the planet is separated by wealth and breed. Animal-human-hybrid people live in lower areas, where the air is steeped with "seither," a magical element that can be toxic in high doses, but can also be used to power weapons and other abilities. The higher classes live above the seither fog, also the home of the Librarium, an organization that maintains law and order. The Librarium also seems to pocess some secret power that allows them to turn back time, allowing them to avoid catastrophe or any other fate for the world they deem unsatisfactory. Ragna the Bloodedge is the protagonist, a wanted fellon for crimes he may or may not have committed. He's generally a good guy, but avoids the Librarium forces whenever possible, less he wants a fight. He's aware the Librarium has some power that could threaten the world (or at least, the time-reversal tool that effectively removes their human rights), and tries to fight his way to the top of their tower. Until they reverse time, and he has to go through it again. This worked well in the context of the video game: after choosing a character, you complete a short story mode that is slightly different from the other characters, but held during the same time period, slowly understanding more of the characters and the story each time you play.</br></br>But does that translate to a 12-episode anime? Sort of. Most gamers couldn't care less about the story in the games anyway, claiming it to be confusing nonsense, and immediately proceeding to the online multiplayer. That type of person will feel the same about "Alter Memory." On the other hand, dedicated fans will appreciate that while the anime still covers the same general period of "Calamity Trigger" and "Continuum Shift," it doesn't simply restate the same story or events. In fact, it expands upon it, adding new details or events that prove to be interesting in the grander context. In dedication to the games, it even includes its own version of 'joke' scenes, a common option in the branching visual-novel story of the games. "Blazblue" is a franchise you understand better with each new entry you experience, and while "Alter Memory's" story isn't truly necessary, it should be considered essential to existing fans, just as much as any one of the games.</br></br><img src="../ReviewImages/review_Blazblue_-_Alter_Memory2.jpg" alt="" style="width:720px;height:405px;">
</br></br>Again, if you haven't played the games, the story is stuipd. The range varies greatly, depending on the viewer.</br></br>The production values leave a lot to be desired, in part due to the games themselves. The character designs vary wildly, as if a dozen separate deviantArt artists threw in their favorite original work. We have big red coats, blue flowing robes, Cowboy-style suits, cat girls, gothic vampire girls, Japanese clothing, humanoid robots, and a lot more, sometimes all in the same scene. It's fun to see such diversity in the games, but I'd be lying if I said I thought the art was ever "good." The animation of the show, by relatively unknown studio Hoods Entertainment, seems to be meant to match the quality of the 2D cutscenes and openings from the games... which never looked great. Overall, colors are flat, motion is limited, and fight scenes are floaty with no real sense of weight. Frankly, the show looks barely acceptable for an action show from 2003, not a great sign in 2013.</br></br>The music is generally good. In the games, it was great, but even when the same tracks are used, it doesn't feel as effective in "Alter Memory." The English dub in the games was also great, even if it was a little corny at times, and after the latest game in the series ("Central Fiction," 2016) released without an English dub option, I've learned not to take that for granted. Using the same actors as the games, the characters feel like old friends when I see and hear them in the show.</br></br>So whether or not you should watch "Blazblue - Alter Memory" should be clear. If you've never played the games, even if you think you want to get into it, "Alter Memory" is not a great way to do it, and won't leave you impressed. If you have played any of the games, it's worthwhile to pick up the show for cheap from Funimation's "S.A.V.E." Bluray line. Those fans won't think of this as a new favorite anime either, but would be happy to put it alongside their games on the shelf.</br></br></p>
