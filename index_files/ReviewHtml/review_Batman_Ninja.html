<p>Disclaimer: while I don't normally review CGI animated films, "Batman Ninja" does have scenes of hybrid, and sometimes fully 2D, animation, so I made an exception here.</br></br>I'm not one to shy away from my opinion of direct-to-video DC superhero animated movies: I don't like them. Even from the 1990's with the iconic "Batman: The Animated Series" designs, the animation never looked right to me. It was too rigid, lacking in any expression, the visuals lacking in any detail. Even if the stories were any good (and they weren't particularly so: only passable by standards of monthly super-hero comic books), having animation that looked like it was produced for $10 by Chinese factory-workers wasn't very appealing. The major exceptions to the rule have always been when Warner Bros. Animation let go of the reins, typically when letting Japan handle the work directly. It doesn't happen often. "Batman Ninja" was, therefore, a revelation to fans.</br></br>Even the moment when it was first revealed, there was tremendous hype around the movie. It would be fully CGI, but actually look good? It would have character designs by Takashi Okazaki, the man behind Emmy-Award winning US-Japan fusion "Afro Samurai"? It would be set in Japan, just for the fun of it? I'm intrigued. "Batman Ninja" may or may not be one of the best direct-to-video animated films Warner Bros put out for it's DC universe, but I think it's safe to agree that it is its' most exciting. </br></br>Admittedly, the story is stupid. Most super-hero movies don't have great stories, but at least good ones, if you have any investment in the characters. "Batman Ninja" throws its cards out the window, setting up a story purely as an excuse to have Batman travel to Japan and fight the Joker as a ninja. Basically, classic villain Gorilla Grodd has created a time-travel machine with the intention to send the rest of the rogues-gallery to the past and out of his way. When Batman intervenes, it backfires, sending everyone (Batman, Grodd, Joker, Harley, Catwoman, Robin, other Robin, other-other-used-to-be-Robin, etc.) to feudal Japan. Conveniently for the story, Batman arrives a couple years after the others, giving the villains time to take over and lead Japan's warring states and for Catwoman to introduce him to the situation they find themselves in. Can the Joker defeat the others and unify Japan as a country of madman, changing history forever? Not on Batman's watch!</br></br>Joker and Harley Quinn make up the most interesting part of the story. Yes, Batman does "grow" as a character, by realizing his technology isn't what makes him a hero, but the Joker gives an impressive performance to fool Batman half-way through the story. Even then, the story is virtually meaningless: this movie really exists for the action set-pieces. Robin and a tiny monkey friend leading an army of monkeys to attack? A Gundam-style robot made of Japanese temples? A sword-fight between Joker and Batman at the climax? Screw the story! GimmeGmmeGimme!</br></br>While I was hesitant to watch a fully-CGI animated film of the Batman, the movie owns its style so well that it's hard to not be impressed, even if Batman's movements are occasionally a little clunky. The numerous action scenes make great use of camera shots that would be nearly impossible in 2D animation. There are plenty of other little details to appreciate throughout the movie: one that made me laugh was Joker's radar screen, shown as light-puppet shows and Japanese scrolls (electricity didn't exist back then, after all). The movie also uses experimental animation more often than I expected. Expository dialogue occurs over detailed transitions of character art, not unlike the stylish 2018 video game "Persona 5." And there's a lengthy scene in the middle that is entirely done in 2D animation, but so abstract from common anime that I'd swear Studio 4C is the only studio that could have pulled it off. Whatever biases you may hold, it's hard to deny this is a beautiful movie that all animation fans should watch.</br></br>Speaking of designs, I've heard some say Catwoman and Harley Quinn were sexualized a bit here, but aside from both Harley and Joker wagging their tongues a lot, this seemed a lot tamer than even most of their modern comics. Even blood didn't seem too explicit, so I'd have no problems recommending this to parents with 8-year olds (and this might be one of the rare Batman movies a parent would be interested in watching themselves). </br></br>The music is inspired, with an iconic string-theme playing during a rousing climactic battle. The English dub is generally good, but like most Japanese CGI, lip-syncing is harder to get right than it is with 2D animation. Curiously, the dialogue also varies wildly between English and Japanese, so I'd recommend watching both, and if only one, choose Japanese for the novelty. </br></br>This isn't the only time Batman would go on a adventure outside his regular time period. But other attempts still look poor by comparison. To take it's animation seriously, Batman simply has to be animated either entirely in Japan, or entirely in-house at a experienced American studio. Even with Hollywood involved, there's something appealing and unique about Japanese anime that can't easily be reproduced. Batman won't get this treatment often, and really, he shouldn't. But when we get a gift, be grateful and enjoy it while you can.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
