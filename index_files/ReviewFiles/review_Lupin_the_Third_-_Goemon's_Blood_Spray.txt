{"index":-1,"title":"Lupin the Third - Goemon's Blood Spray","format":"Film","review":"\tFinally! I've been waiting for Discotek to release Takeshi Koike's follow-up to the Lupin the Third 2-part episode/film \"Jigen's Gravestone\" with great anticipation, only to be left hanging for years. That American Bluray came out in 2016 complete with a dub: yes, a couple years after Japan, but by the time it did, two new films were already in production. \"Goemon's Blood Spray\" came out in 2017 in Japan, and was made available in America exclusively through Amazon's streaming service, directly by TMS Entertainment Japan, subtitled-only, with no physical release in sight. Not what I had in mind... I understand Japanese producers wanting to have more ownership and profit from international markets, but I'm old-fashioned, and still watch my anime on a big-screen television. \n\tIt wouldn't be until 2019, over three years after my watching \"Gravestone,\" that salvation would come. The third follow-up, \"Fujiko Mine's Lie,\" would get an American premiere at an anime convention just months after it's Japanese theatrical release. Even better, it would be a double-feature, coupled with \"Goemon's Blood Spray,\" and with an English dub for both! Discotek remained coy, despite selling merchandise for the new films at their convention booth, but within a week they confirmed they had the physical license for both, and \"Goemon's Blood Spray\" would finally be released a few months later. Based on this strategy, despite the dub already being produced, I'm certain I'll be waiting until 2021 to get the final film for this bizarre trilogy, but at least I know it'll come eventually. \n\tAnyway, if you aren't already familiar, this trilogy of films is a spin-off for the existing spin-off for the famous \"Lupin the Third\" franchise: \"The Woman Called Fujiko Mine.\" This time, directed by the character designer Takeshi Koike (best known for prolific film \"Redline\"), these new movies were dark and gritty takes on the series, not shying away from blood or sex. In fact, they might be the most violent we've seen of Lupin, even more so than \"The Woman Called.\" Traditionalists might balk at this adult-version of a typically comic character, but with Koike's cool-style driving it, I couldn't get enough. Even with over 30 feature-length films and specials, I'd easily put \"Jigen's Gravestone\" in the top 5, and wouldn't be surprised if I put the two follow-up films in there too.\n\tBut was \"Jigen's Gravestone\" just a lucky fluke? This new two-episode-compiled-into-a-movie special centers around Goemon, which already poses a challenge: making Goemon look cool. Frankly, the silent samurai never fit in to the modern heist-thriller series. His ability to cut virtually anything with his sword (and his typical annoyance at what his sacred skills are being used for) made him accidently be the comic-relief, or go-to for getting Lupin and his friends out of a tight spot. \n\tMiraculously, \"Goemon's Blood Spray\" does the character justice, thanks to him meeting a equally-bizarre foe that makes him question his abilities: Hawk, a large lumberjack-style of a man that could have come from either Texas or Canada, with metal teeth under his bushy beard, wielding two hand-axes with enough strength and precision to block bullets and take down a cruise ship. He's a private hitman who seems to have a mark for Lupin, Jigen and Fujiko. When a unrelated gang leader is killed in the line of fire, a man the Goemon was hired to protect, Goemon's reputation is on the line... but Hawk effortlessly catches his sword with his bare hands, breaking it from its hilt. Goemon himself feels broken, and ultimately has to \"reforge\" himself back into a stronger force to take down this worthy foe.\n\tThe story leaves me wanting: unlike \"Jigen's Gravestone,\" Lupin and the gang have little involvement with the new hitman (other than being the target), and don't really have a hand in Goemon's transformation. The motivation behind Hawk is left unanswered: the movie acknowledges that he must have a boss that ordered for Lupin's death, but we never see or hear from this source, presumably a secret left for a future film or special. While \"Gravestone\" had a twist or two, \"Blood Spray\" relies on sheer will and drama. It's a different type of movie. Still plenty exciting, like a great samurai film, but I definitely had more of a sense that the story was written in haste after the success of the one-off special that came before. \n\tThere no nudity this time, but a surprising amount of violence. Both Goemon and Hawk hack a lot of limbs off, and ultimately, Goemon himself is left with major scars that, in theory, would be impossible to heal or hide in future films. Stylistically, the character designs still look great, and there are a handful of cool animated moments, although I felt like the animation overall was a bit more limited (which still makes it a step above most other Lupin animated works). The English dub is reasonably good (although I can't say I felt accustomed to Goemon's English voice... maybe because he doesn't normally talk much anyway), and the soundtrack remains cool, with jazzy James-Bond-esque overtones. \n\tIt's hard for lightning to strike twice, and I definitely feel like \"Goemon's Blood Spray\" is weaker than \"Jigen's Gravestone.\" But that's partially because there's practically a different genre of film here, and possibly workings to tie it to a secret larger story arc. And the strengths of this trilogy remain solid, making for a riviting action tale for these classic characters. \n\tNow, hurry up and give me the \"Lie.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","scoreTotal":4.0,"scoreAni":3.5,"scoreVisual":4.5,"scoreAudio":4.5,"scoreAct":3.5,"scoreStory":3.0,"scoreFun":4.5,"scoreBias":4.5,"action":true,"adventure":false,"philosophy":false,"comedy":false,"erotic":false,"horror":false,"family":false,"romance":false,"experimental":false,"fantasy":false,"scifi":false,"drama":true,"mystery":false,"thriller":true,"nonfiction":false,"sports":false,"ownBluray":true,"ownDVD":false,"ownCombo":false,"pastBluray":false,"pastDVD":false,"pastCombo":false,"runtime":52.0,"year":2017,"country":"Japan","studio":"TMS Entertainment","director":"Takeshi Koike"}
