{"index":-1,"title":"Monogatari Series - Final Season","format":"TV","review":"\tDisclaimer: This review covers \"Tsukimonogatari\" (4 episodes), \"Owarimonogatari\" (20 episodes, released in three sets by Aniplex USA), and \"Koyomimonogatari\" (12 half-length episodes), released between 2014 and 2017.\n\tFINALLY! After being roped into the excellent first season of \"Bakemonogatari\" (broadcast in 2009), the story appears to be coming to a close in \"Monogatari - Final Season.\" In total, \"Final Season\" brings the episode count to 82, not including the odd case of \"Koyomimonogatari\" or the film trilogy \"Kizumonogatari.\" At the time of this writing, this is probably the longest single series I've ever invested myself in. And thanks to Aniplex USA, it's one of the most expensive to invest in as well: the exclusive Bluray-only subtitled released will require almost $1000 USD to own in it's entirety. But at least, finally, it was over, and we might be satisfied with a concrete ending.\n\t... except it isn't. At the time of this writing, an addendum arc called \"Zoku Owarimonogatari\" (literally meaning \"Continued End Story\") was released as well. It isn't yet certain that more will follow, so official sites include as part of the \"Final Season,\" although Studio Shaft has admitted that with dozens of remaining stories from the novels not yet adapted, they may very well keep going if the demand exists. And based on fan feedback, I'm certain it will continue. I don't include \"Zoku\" in this particular review: personally, I'm done. While these complex and arguably human characters may continue to grow, a story must have an ending. Otherwise it really is just a life, as special and as common as a grain of sand. \n\tThankfully, for having come this far, \"Final Season\" doesn't disappoint. Miraculously, it manages to tie everything together in expectedly neat ways, and offers a surprisingly happy ending for everyone. Almost TOO happy, perhaps, but that they found a way to do it at all leaves me impressed. Of course, if you haven't kept up with ALL of the \"Monogatari\" series (including the \"Kizumonogatari\" films), you will likely be confused; it's strictly for fans only.\n\tAs a reminder, the series as a whole is roughly about Araragi, a half-vampire teenager, who discovers and helps a series of girls with apparitions haunting and cursing their lives in their Japanese town. If the first season was about Araragi helping these girls, and \"Second Season\" was about those girls learning to help themselves, then \"Final Season\" is about Araragi learning to help himself. \"Tsukimonogatari\" could very well be confused as part of \"Second Season,\" but the way the dialogue goes on, it's clear it means to present itself as the start of the end. Aside from arguably the most risque fanservice yet (involving lead character Araragi taking a bath with one of his sisters), it makes clear that Araragi's vampire state can't be continued. \"Owarimonogatari\" is the meat of the ending, containing a few story lines: one about a new girl from Araragi's childhood whom he had completely failed to save, a story involving Hachikuji (a wonderful sight after her sad end in \"Second Season\"), and even a romantic date with Senjogahara. But most of all, it's about resolving the series-long issue: the town's shrine is missing a God, and one must be set in order to prevent further calamity from coming to this one town. Also, \"Owarimonogatari\" finally reveals more about Ougi Oshino.\n\tOugi, the mysterious underclassman, slender and not quite fitting her school uniform, pale as a ghost, with large black pupils that fill her eyes, and an eerie smile. She was a new side character in \"Second Season,\" seemingly without malicious intent, but suspicious in terms of her knowledge and meddling. How does she know the missing mentor Meme Oshino? Why claim to be related when it's hinted that Meme Oshino doesn't have a niece? Unlike other catchphrases, like \"I only know what I know\" or \"I know everything,\" she insists \"I don't know anything... but YOU know, Araragi.\" Somehow, Araragi can't help but confide in her, even though he knows something is off about her. Ultimately, her role becomes integral to the climax of the series, and while I was disappointed with what her \"secret identy\" really turned out to be, I was happy with how it was otherwise handled. \n\tThe stories otherwise feel a bit more refreshing, at least compared to \"Second Season,\" partially because they were leading to a clear end, and because of a greater use of Mathematics and logic, setting up the first couple of arcs in \"Owarimonogatari\" like genuine mysteries. One of the opening themes even uses a numeric code as the lyrics, requiring the viewer (at least, a non-Japanese-speaking viewer) to translate them themselves to get the words. It's better than the standard supernatural stories mixed with fanservice the series had been used to.\n\tGenerally, the series is slightly more condensed than before, but only slightly; it would take at least two sentences to summarize each episode rather than one. Answering one question always seems to bring out two more questions, and characters are happy to spend an extra five minutes dedicated to every single answer. It's still longer than it needs to be, especially compared to the first season, but as a fan, I was willing to let it slide and bask in the jokes and wordplay. There are two noticable changes in wording and pacing compared to previous seasons: characters often refer to the \"readers,\" breaking the fourth wall, which partially makes sense given how much reading is necessary with the subtitles, but was clearly meant for the original novels, and lazily not changed to \"viewers\" instead. Another is the use of introducing the end of an arc as \"the epilogue or punchline of this story\" by Araragi, which never really needed to be pointed out. Also, several title cards listing the current \"chapter\" of the book make it easier to follow what book to buy if you want to get the original content. Buyers in the USA will notice that the arcs are generally smaller than usual, forcing Aniplex USA to group \"Owarimonogatari\" into three separate sets instead of seven, also increasing the price per set, but not necessary per episode.\n\tThe visuals and animation are slightly better and more distinct than \"Second Season,\" but not by much. Even if the animation is often static, and even if the art style is just following the template from previous seasons, I continue to remain impressed by the most stylish anime of the decade. Music includes a bunch of new opening and ending themes, a few of which I'd consider as catch as those form the first season. The acting is a bit better too, in Japanese only of course, thanks to a greater variety of characters. \n\tOh, regarding \"Koyomimonogatari.\" It's a strange project, consisting of 12 episodes, each only about twelve minutes long, originally published in a mobile app, but eventually released as a stand-alone set by Aniplex USA in America. Each episode is typically humorous, taking place throughout the entire series, consisting of Araragi speaking with one of the other characters about a ghost story they've heard of, usually concluding that it was just a story and not of any real meaning, and occasionally refering to the events from the main storyline. Reusing openings from the show, but using a brand new ending theme, the fact that it was released for mobile screens doesn't affect the production quality at all. Ultimately, the episodes are entirely skippable, not providing significant story content, just a little extra time with your favorite characters in short bursts, very much like a series of bonus OVA's (except for the final episode, which acts as a helpful but unnecessary prologue to the second half of \"Owari\"). Whether or not that is of value to you depends on the reason you enjoy the series.\n\tI still believe \"Bakemonogatari\" is a great series, and anime fans owe it to themselves to watch both \"Bake\" and \"Nise.\" For the sake of time or money, one should stop there. If you insist on continuing, you must commit yourself to watching both \"Second Season\" and \"Final Season\" before another option to break opens. But \"Monogatari - Final Season\" explains events from both the first and second seasons in new ways, and manages to tie everything up into a neat ending as your final reward. It's a bit too happy of an ending, but I'll accept it. The ending also makes clear that, while this particular story might be over, Araragi may very well have other new stories to follow. I'll take that as an opportunity to close the book on an excellent series: it'll be nice to know the story continues, but I won't particularly care to hear any more of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n","scoreTotal":3.7100000381469728,"scoreAni":3.0,"scoreVisual":4.0,"scoreAudio":4.0,"scoreAct":4.0,"scoreStory":4.0,"scoreFun":3.5,"scoreBias":3.5,"action":false,"adventure":false,"philosophy":true,"comedy":true,"erotic":true,"horror":true,"family":false,"romance":true,"experimental":true,"fantasy":true,"scifi":false,"drama":false,"mystery":true,"thriller":false,"nonfiction":false,"sports":false,"ownBluray":true,"ownDVD":false,"ownCombo":false,"pastBluray":false,"pastDVD":false,"pastCombo":false,"runtime":752.0,"year":2014,"country":"Japan","studio":"Shaft","director":"Akiyuki Shinbo, Tomoyuki Itamura"}
