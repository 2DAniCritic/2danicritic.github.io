{"index":-1,"title":"Fate - Stay Night","format":"TV","review":"\tHardcore anime fans will recognize \"Type Moon\" as a company specializing in dark-fantasy visual novels, reusing certain themes and character designs, and suggesting that their multiple franchisees exist in a shared universe. My first exposure to it was in \"Fate / Zero,\" a 2011 anime prequel to the famouse visual novel \"Fate / Stay Night.\" FZ was fantastic, and I was immediately drawn to see more of the \"Fate\" universe. I wasn't left wanting, as there were already several adaptations, and many more prequels, sequels, retellings and spin-offs would be made in the years to follow. Anyway, for most people, their first experience with \"Type Moon\" in anime was in 2006's \"Fate / Stay Night,\" the first animated adaptation of it.\n\tUnfortunately, a common critizism of 2006's \"Fate / Stay Night\" is that is itsn't very good. Heck, there would later be a feature film, then another TV show, then a trilogy of films, all of which retell THE EXACT SAME STORY, which more adaptations still possible after 2018... had the original attempt been successful, there would be no reason to keep retrying. Anyway, having seen FSN after FZ, I was impressed with how well it turned out. But it is still a wreck.  \n\tThe main character is Shiro, a typical good boy at a Japanese high-school. He accidently gets involved in The Holy Grail War, a magnificent battle held in secret where seven sages fight for a magical item that can grant any one wish. Each sage summons a legendary hero from myth and history to fight for them, and so fantastical battle scenes ensue throughout the city. Shiro finds himself paired with none other than the legendary King Aurthur, who in a clever turn of artistic license happens to be a woman. Uncovering and developing his own magical abilities, Shiro fights in order to end the fighting and carnage. \n\tFrom the start, the premise is great. The franchise remains the closest I've seen to a good \"educational' anime, since it introduces several fascinating characters from history and literature, and because the anime exagerrates and changes certain character traits, it is incredibly tempting to spend hours online researching the real backstory behind them. And the setup provides ample opportunity for great action scenes, as well as drama and philosophy (each character has their own reasons for wanting the Holy Grail). But in this show, the pacing feels wrong... so wrong. Being based on a visual novel, the episodes change from slice-of-life, to romance, to harem comedy, to action, back  to harem... the original visual novel technically had erotic content, which seems to be the only genre left (mostly) out of the anime. Many fanservice elements feel unnecessary: there is no benefit to the story to have five different romantic interests living under the same roof as the main character. As to the legendary servants, their backgrounds are not well-explained within the show, and the other opponents opposite of Shiro (and co-partner Rin) don't get much development. Some even don't appear or get mentioned until the last few episodes! The show has an air of self-importance, which feels unnatural given how poorly they handle the content. The ending feels mostly satisfying at least.\n\tVisuals make the show look older than it really is, but a select few battle scenes are well-animated. Character designs from \"Type Moon\" mean they have a unique and appealing style, but if you have seen any of their other work, it won't feel as unique after a point. The English dub was fine, and the music was fair, if barely serviceable.\n\tOverall, 2006's \"Fate / Stay Night\" pales in comparison to \"Fate / Zero,\" and the alternative retellings suggset the original visual novel was a bit of a mess that cannot be fully saved. There are enough good ideas in the show to be impressed, and if it is your very first introduction to the world, I can understand why you might fall in love with it. But there is so much more you can choose from... even within \"Type Moon\" 's catalogue, you would be wise to look elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n","scoreTotal":2.640000104904175,"scoreAni":3.0,"scoreVisual":3.0,"scoreAudio":3.0,"scoreAct":3.0,"scoreStory":2.0,"scoreFun":2.5,"scoreBias":2.0,"action":true,"adventure":true,"philosophy":false,"comedy":false,"erotic":false,"horror":false,"family":false,"romance":false,"experimental":false,"fantasy":true,"scifi":false,"drama":false,"mystery":false,"thriller":false,"nonfiction":false,"sports":false,"ownBluray":false,"ownDVD":true,"ownCombo":false,"pastBluray":false,"pastDVD":false,"pastCombo":false,"runtime":600.0,"year":2006,"country":"Japan","studio":"Studio Deen","director":"Yuji Yamaguchi"}
