{"index":-1,"title":"Death Note - R (Relight), Visions of a God, R2 (Relight2), L's Successors","format":"Film","review":"\tDisclaimer: This review covers the two recap films to the \"Death Note\" anime: 2007 film \"Death Note: Relight - Visions of a God\" and 2008 film \"Death Note: Relight 2 - L's Successors.\" \n\tDisclaimer: Spoilers.\n\t\"Death Note\" was my true gateway anime. I had seen anime before that, but nothing had gotten me hooked so quickly, and ever since, I have been searching for that feeling like a drug with every new anime I watch. Even a decade later, its legacy is true.\n\tBut perhaps you don't want to sit through 37 episodes of dark-fantasy and cat-and-mouse crime thriller? Don't worry: there's a compilation film that covers the first two-thirds of the series, called \"Relight - Visions of a God.\" Apparently, that recap was successful enough to create a second compilation for the last third, called \"Relight 2 - L's Successors.\" Recap films are not unusual for anime (usually to make extra money without reanimating a story, or to hype an audience for a sequel season), but these usually don't get released outside of Japan. \"Death Note\" proved popular enough for Viz Media to go ahead and dub/release these two films (shortened to \"R\" and \"R2\") on DVD, and later keeping them as a bonus feature for an eventual Bluray release. \n\tAnother common issue with recap anime films is poor editing, struggling to reduce several episodes of content to just one or two, and the lack of any real purpose to the film's existence. \"R\" and \"R2\" suffer from these same issues. If possible, watching the full series is still definitely the best way to experience the story. But at the same time, there are a couple interesting features that make the two films worth watching for existing fans, and possibly acceptable for new ones. \n\tThe core story to \"Death Note\" involves the existence of Shinigami, demon-like creatures that each have their own notebook that allows them to kill human lives at will. One Shinigami named Ryuk simply gets bored one day, and drops the notebook into the human world to watch what happens. Light Yagami, a bright Japanese student, finds the book, and when he realizes the book to not just be a prank, he quietly begins to kill off criminals around the world, cleansing the human race. Noticing a string of suspicious deaths, the world's police begin to act, hiring a mysterious detective only known as \"L\" to track down the culprit and the method. Both Light (known by the public as \"Kira\") and L know the existence of each other, but not the identity, the things they need to stop each other. Step by step, they each play a game of mind chess, trying to put each other in check. Naturally, Ryuk is pleased with how interesting the whole thing becomes. \n\tAs a major spoiler (which you might gather from the second film's title), L dies midway through the series. \"R\" recaps events from the first episode up to that crucial event, before skipping quickly ahead to show that Light eventually meets his own demise. This is bookended by new scenes: Ryuk, now blind, recalls the story to another curious Shinigami. The world of the Shinigami was never expanded to its fullest in the series, so seeing any new material from there is a treat, and the added scenes give further weight to the theory of what really becomes of Light after he dies (there's no real merit to it, but fans of the theory, like me, will certainly point with excitement at it). There's also a fantastic new scene of Light Yagami at L's funeral, barely able to contain himself in front of the police force he managed to trick. \n\tIf you were left hungry for more for the lore behind \"Death Note,\" those new scenes make \"R\" worth watching after the main series. However, it isn't an ideal way to experience the events of the story. There's less time for suspense, so we see solutions appear almost as quickly as each problem, without the binge-watch excitement of getting to the next episode. Editing each episode down to as little as 5 minutes is done with minimal attention, lacking the skill to create a cohesive story. A new viewer could probably gather what happnens in the series from \"R\" alone, but they would also be left wondering why anyone fell in love with the series to begin with. Somehow, reusing so many aspects of production (animation, audio, etc.) also cheapens them, coming off as less impressive than the whole product of the series. \n\tBesides the handful of new scenes, the biggest merit to \"R\" is not having to watch the final third of the main series. It's a common opinion that the series gets worse without L around, and with \"R,\" the viewer doesn't have to sit through the events that follow. It leaves a lot of questions to exactly how Light meets his end, but it's something a new fan could read in a Wikipedia page. Existing fans might prefer \"R\" as a summary of the best parts of the series, and choose to ignore what's missing. \n\tThat unexpected feature is also a big reason to why I found myself enjoying \"R2,\" even though I had already watched the full series. \"R2\" starts right after L's death, with the only major new scenes involving an introduction by L himself, in a rather funny speech. Like the series, we learn briefly of L's backstory, and see two new detectives (\"M\" and \"N\") appear to stop Kira once and for all. This time, the amount of episodes to reduce is less, and the reduced runtime of a single movie becomes a more idealized way to revist the events of the final act. \n\tYes, that original final act was a little bit of a slog in the series. It made it clear that the show HAD to end with Light's death, and both \"M\" and \"N,\" for all the new odd quirks they are given, simply aren't as interesting as L: at best, they are parodies of a better character. But the events are still important to see how Light dies. If you told me that I could quickly skim through these events in 100 minutes instead of 4 hours, I would say \"yes please!\" Therefore, existing fans will probably enjoy having \"R2\" on hand opposed to watching the worst part of the show, and new fans will be able to follow along well enough to get the jist (assuming they either saw the first parts of the series, or \"R,\" or the manga). Although, the only likely reason a fan wouldn't already have the full anime or manga available would be if they only watched \"R,\" so... yeah. \n\t\"Death Note R\" and \"Death Note R2\" are definitely examples of why recap anime films aren't great: it's hard to reduce a complex series of events without excessive re-writes, including new animation and dialogue (the cost of which would ruin the point for a studio to bother). But for existing fans, the handful of new scenes are great for completionists, and \"R2\" in particular is a good way to summarize the weakest part of the series. And the original source is just so engaging already, that it's hard to not feel a fondness, even in a less than ideal experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n","scoreTotal":3.7100000381469728,"scoreAni":3.5,"scoreVisual":4.0,"scoreAudio":4.0,"scoreAct":4.5,"scoreStory":3.5,"scoreFun":3.5,"scoreBias":3.0,"action":false,"adventure":false,"philosophy":true,"comedy":false,"erotic":false,"horror":true,"family":false,"romance":false,"experimental":false,"fantasy":false,"scifi":false,"drama":true,"mystery":true,"thriller":true,"nonfiction":false,"sports":false,"ownBluray":false,"ownDVD":true,"ownCombo":false,"pastBluray":false,"pastDVD":false,"pastCombo":false,"runtime":230.0,"year":2007,"country":"Japan","studio":"Madhouse","director":"Tetsuro Araki"}
