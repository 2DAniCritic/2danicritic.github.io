{"index":-1,"title":"Blood Blockade Battlefront & Beyond","format":"TV","review":"\tThe first season of \"Blood Blockade Battlefront\" was a treat, even if the story didn't come together all that well in the end. Based on a manga by Yasuhiro Nightow, a lot of credit was given to the series director: Rie Matsumoto. However, after post-poning the season finale, and ultimately not delivering on concluding the story well, Matsumoto was quietly released from the announced second season of \"Blood Blockade,\" suspiciously not returning to direct anything as of 2019. A shame, but I can't comment on any behind-the-scenes issues in development.\n\tHowever, replacing the director with Shigehito Takayanagi, at the time known for directing \"Dagashi Kashi,\" \"Tokyo ESP,\" and \"The World God Only Knows,\" didn't seem encouraging. While relatively experienced, could \"Blood Blockade Battlefront & Beyond\" succeed without the artisitc vision of Matsumoto? It would rely on at least competence from the new director, the creativity of the source material, and the talent of animation studio Bones. \n\tDespite any concerns, I'm happy to say the second season not only meets, but in some ways, exceeds the first season. Fans need not be concerned: this is still one of the best anime franchises of the 2010's decade. \n\tIt starts quickly, right where the first sesaon left off, and despite being episodic and without much of a storyline to continue, new fans might be lost if they haven't already seen the first season. Leonardo Watch is still trying to survive living in Hellsalem's Lot, where interdimensional monsters and aliens have emerged and co-existed with what was previously New York City. Leonardo continues to work for Libra, an organization that keeps the peace whenever Godzilla-sized creatures start killing thousands of civilians (almost every day). \n\tLeonardo's motivation to live there was always rooted in his \"all-seeing eyes of the Gods,\" granted to him against his will at the expense of his sister's eyesight, which he desparately wishes to reverse for his sister's sake. While this storyline was mostly ignored for a new arc in the first season (whose characters are still recognized in the second season, even if there aren't particularly important this time around), it is hinted to be more important this time, concluding with a two-part conclusion that finally gives his sister Michella some focus and screen time. One would think the lack of an over-arching arc might poorly effect the story of \"Beyond,\" but the episodic stories are still entertaining in their provided format. They instead focus on individual events and secret lives of some of the side-characters in Libra, adding some much-appreciated depth, and confirming how badass the entire group is when trouble is afoot. The story content is a bit more mature (as in, using sex and dark violence more often for comedic purposes), and feels a little more daring because of it. Overall, the story is less ambitious, but more consistently great across the 12-episodes.\n\tStudio Bones deserves a lot of credit for \"Beyond\" : while the first season looked good (with a couple inconsistencies in the animation), the second season takes the animation up another level. There are action scenes in almost every episode, and each time, the animation gets ambitious with dynamic camera shots and character movement. Aside from a few episodes in the last third, this exciting spectacle is maintained, making for a significantly more impressive experience. The music too has improved: while the opening and endings can't hold a candle to the original, they are still catchy, and the background music uses multiple vocal rap tunes that elevate the urban atmosphere of the city. \n\tAnd while not occuring as often, there are still several references to Nightow's legacy as a manga artist. All while maintaining a grand sense of fun that doesn't get matched often. I can't say for certain now where the ownership to \"Beyond\"'s success comes from, but I guess it doesn't matter. Get in on this now: \"these are the winning odds you've been waiting for.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","scoreTotal":4.289999961853027,"scoreAni":4.0,"scoreVisual":4.0,"scoreAudio":4.5,"scoreAct":4.0,"scoreStory":4.0,"scoreFun":4.5,"scoreBias":5.0,"action":true,"adventure":false,"philosophy":false,"comedy":true,"erotic":false,"horror":true,"family":false,"romance":false,"experimental":false,"fantasy":true,"scifi":false,"drama":false,"mystery":false,"thriller":false,"nonfiction":false,"sports":false,"ownBluray":false,"ownDVD":false,"ownCombo":true,"pastBluray":false,"pastDVD":false,"pastCombo":false,"runtime":300.0,"year":2017,"country":"Japan","studio":"Bones","director":"Shigehito Takayanagi"}
