{"index":-1,"title":"The Secret of Nimh","format":"Film","review":"\tI should have seen \"The Secret of Nimh\" a long time ago, but I finally got around to it. It is the first of many films that Don Bluth would direct, and is still considered one of his best. And after watching it, all I can say is \"wow.\" \n\tIt's dangerous being a mouse in a farm field. Poor Mrs. Brisby's husband passed away mysteriously, and her youngest child is fatally sick at a time when the farm land is being tilled, and they can't stay in their house. Not knowing what to do, Mrs. Brisby seeks help from the wisest creatures in the area to keep her family safe. Little does she know that she will learn more about why her husband died, and the secret of the mysterious rats of Nimh.\n\tThis sounds more mature than your standard children's story, and that's why I like it. From the second it starts, it has a grim seriousness that rivals the best dark fantasy stories, and yet still maintains the innocence and heart of the best Disney films. Most of the characters are more redeemable than typically seen in a children's movie, mixing both stereotypical and non-typical archetypes admirably. Mrs. Brisby is a timid mouse with only her love for her family pushing her forward, and only through her courage and her friends' help does she manage to get through life-risking events. The film can easily scare young children, but also excite them and make them laugh. These types of films are rare, and should be cherished. It is a shame that the last half-hour of the film noticeably isn't well edited, as it's the only thing holding it back.\n\tThe animation is the start of Don Bluth's trademark style, by which I mean this looks exactly like a Disney movie. The characters are all expressive and are well designed. The backgrounds, while static, are beautifully painted, if you don't mind old-fashioned art. The Bluray transfer is ok, although a few certain shots look noticeably blurry. The voice acting is done by actors you would surely recognize from several other films, but is fitting all the same. Music helps set the tone of the scenes expertly.\n\tThe film was apparently made from a garage of talented, dedicated animators with a love for the craft. Animators must see this film and learn of its history, there simply isn't an option. Everyone else who hasn't yet seen \"The Secret of Nimh\" likely won't know what to expect, and after viewing, will walk away in awe.\n\n\n\n\n\n","scoreTotal":4.360000133514404,"scoreAni":4.5,"scoreVisual":4.0,"scoreAudio":4.5,"scoreAct":4.5,"scoreStory":4.5,"scoreFun":4.5,"scoreBias":4.0,"action":false,"adventure":true,"philosophy":true,"comedy":false,"erotic":false,"horror":false,"family":true,"romance":false,"experimental":false,"fantasy":true,"scifi":false,"drama":false,"mystery":true,"thriller":false,"nonfiction":false,"sports":false,"ownBluray":true,"ownDVD":false,"ownCombo":false,"pastBluray":false,"pastDVD":false,"pastCombo":false,"runtime":82.0,"year":1982,"country":"USA","studio":"Don Bluth Productions","director":"Don Bluth"}
