{"index":-1,"title":"K - Missing Kings","format":"Film","review":"\tDisclaimer: This review contains spoilers for \"K\" Season 1.\n\tGoHands is a relatively new anime studio that found a unique style in their original series \"K.\" It was undeniably stylish and cool, with vibrant colors and unusually dynamic animation, with a emphasis on moving cameras, unique in 2D productions. It makes sense that the studio would want to expand on this original franchise: they released a sequel film called \"K - Missing Kings\" in 2014, and a sequel season shortly after, and more. \n\tThe animation should be the big reason to return, but it's clear that GoHands was getting a little too ambitious, or perhaps too confident in how things turned out in the first season. At risk at getting ahead of myself, followup television anime \"Hand Shakers\" (2017) and \"W'z\" (2019) have been called the ugliest shows of their year, despite using the same type of style philosophy as \"K.\" This downturn can be partly seen in \"Missing Kings.\" The movie still looks very good, especially in the few action scenes that take place alongside glass buildings at twilight. Animation is mostly still good, if only because it keeps up when the camera moves around moving characters. But it felt a little more overwhelming this time, to it's detriment. Either the team tried harder to push things, or felt too relaxed in repeating the same pattern of design from the original series. \n\tIf there's a real issue with \"Missing Kings,\" it's the story. It takes place shortly after the ending of the first season, and is dependent on the viewier knowing the events that transpired. In a modern city where kings of colors rule the streets, the identity of the Silver King is discovered to be a young boy, who immediately goes missing. During these events, the Red King has also died in battle. The friends of the Silver King (Yashiro Isana) spend most of the movie searching for what became of him, while the remaining cast from the Red clan deal with the loss of their leader. Ultimately, new characters are introduced, and grand revelations are revealed... and that's it. A lot of exposition, a short-term villain, and an ending that might leave viewers confused about the point of it all.\n\t\"Missing Kings\" is clearly an interlude to lead you from Season 1 into Season 2. Therefore, if you intended to continue with the franchise, you will probably need to watch this movie. Beyond that, there isn't much purpose to this movie existing. This type of thing isn't uncommon in anime, to promote and garner excitement in new content. \"Please look forward to it\" is a common phrase by nervous Japanese marketing departments. But personally, I think it makes sense for a film, or series of films to continue the story after a television series, or to provide non-essential prequel information before a series, or a non-essential spin-off story that runs in parallel. To place an essential movie in-between two series requires a little more effort for fans to follow. \n\tThat effort might have been more worthwhile if the story was especially good. But it isn't. It's interesting, especially if you have tried to follow the convoluted lore of \"K.\" But it isn't a good story on its own. With so much exposition, it's the type of side-story that could have been provided through a bonus light novel, perhaps bundled with collector's editions of the new season on Bluray. \n\tI'm still a fan of the original season of \"K,\" and personally found some value in \"K - Missing Kings,\" if only to watch the animators' hard work in rendering a perfectly clean and shiny world with pretty soldiers defending their rulers. But my interest is dwindling. Not having yet seen it at the time of this writing, I hope the sequel season, \"Return of Kings,\" lives up to its expectations, and provides a story or an ending worthy of this world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","scoreTotal":3.140000104904175,"scoreAni":4.0,"scoreVisual":4.0,"scoreAudio":3.5,"scoreAct":3.0,"scoreStory":2.5,"scoreFun":2.5,"scoreBias":2.5,"action":true,"adventure":true,"philosophy":false,"comedy":false,"erotic":false,"horror":false,"family":false,"romance":false,"experimental":false,"fantasy":true,"scifi":false,"drama":true,"mystery":true,"thriller":false,"nonfiction":false,"sports":false,"ownBluray":false,"ownDVD":false,"ownCombo":true,"pastBluray":false,"pastDVD":false,"pastCombo":false,"runtime":73.0,"year":2014,"country":"Japan","studio":"GoHands","director":"Shingo Suzuki"}
